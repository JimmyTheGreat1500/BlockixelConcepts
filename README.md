### Forge Port at https://github.com/OutCraft-Mods/BlockixelConcepts
A Fabric mod that aims to implement Blockixel Artistry on YouTube's unique minecraft concepts. For a full feature list, click ![here](https://github.com/OutCraft-Mods/BlockixelConcepts/wiki). To see which features I plan to add in the near future, see Blockixel Artistry's channel and watch the videos and subscribe, he makes cool stuff.
Thanks to [OutCraft](https://github.com/OutCraft-Mods) again for the forge port an for emotional support...
